# Readme 

This project is just about to learn something about implementation of the Interpreter pattern under C++. 

Regarding to this goal. This example can parse Roman numerals into integers. Herefore the Numerals in the range from 1 := I to 1000 := are implemented. This implementation also consider the cases of 4 := IV and other special cases. See the OneExpression.cpp for details of this special cases.
